I just enabled SSL on this site in a fit of paranoia.  It shouldn't cause any
problems, but please let me know if you notice something that's broken.  Normal
browsing shouldn't be affected, but site login is forced to SSL.  My
(self-signed) certificate has SHA1 fingerprint
`6c:e4:77:91:e8:59:f8:d1:fd:ea:cf:87:6b:af:ce:3b:19:be:fa:b5`.
