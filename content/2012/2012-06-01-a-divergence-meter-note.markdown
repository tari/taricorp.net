Somebody had asked me about the schematics for my [divergence
meter](/projects/divergence-meter.html) project.  All the design files are in the
mercurial repository on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tari/divergence-meter), but here's a
high-resolution capture of the schematic for those unable or unwilling to use
Eagle to view the schematic:
[dm-rev1.1.png](/images/2012/dm-rev1.1.png). 
Be advised that this version of the schematic does not reflect the current
design, as I have not updated it with a FET driver per my last post on this
project.

On the actual project front, I haven't been able to test the FET driver bodge
yet.  Maybe next weekend..
