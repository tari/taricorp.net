Because I had quite the time finding it when I wanted to submit a patch to
[newlib](http://sourceware.org/newlib/), there's a git mirror of the canonical
CVS repository for newlib, which all the patches I saw on the mailing list were
based off of. Maybe somebody else looking for it will find this note useful:


```
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/newlib.git
```

See also: the original [mailing list
announcement](http://sourceware.org/ml/newlib/2011/msg00499.html) of the
mirror's availability.
