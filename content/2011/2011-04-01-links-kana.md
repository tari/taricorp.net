I sometimes use [Links](http://links.twibright.com/) on various computers when I
can't be bothered to deal with a full graphical environment and just want to
look something up. Given I also try to ensure that this site renders in an
acceptable manner in text-only mode, Links is indispensable at times.

Now imagine my surprise when I discovered that Links will try to transliterate
Japanese [kana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana) (a general term for the
scripts in which characters correspond to syllables, rather than more abstract
ideas such as in kanji) to some extent.

</figure>

In that shot, Links has translated the kana in my page's header to a reasonable
romanization- the pronounciation of those characters would be Tari, as in the
beginnings of 'tan' and 'return'. I don't know if that was a recent feature (I'm
currently running Links 2.3pre1), but it was a pleasant surprise to see it
romanizing kana.
