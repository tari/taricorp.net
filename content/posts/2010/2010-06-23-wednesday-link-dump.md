Because I have nothing better to do right now, it's a good time to dump the
interesting links that I've been accumulating.


  * While radioactive hunks of matter are often portrayed as glowing with a
    green tinge, we all know that's not actually true.. unless there's
[Cherenkov Radiation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation)
involved, as in many nuclear reactors- that's not green, though.  <figure> <img
src="/images/2010/Advanced_Test_Reactor.jpg" /> <ficaption>Glowy. Also
radioactive.</figcaption> </figure>
  * Google have (for now) [won the
    suit](http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/06/youtube-wins-case-against-viacom.html)
against them by Viacom regarding[ copyrighted content being
uploaded](http://arstechnica.com/business/2007/03/viacom-sues-youtube-for-copyright-infringement/)
to YouTube, which is good news for everyone except maybe Viacom.  It's still fun
to read [choice excerpts of
correspondence](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/05/f-those-mother-f-ers-youtubeviacom-lawsuit-gets-dirty/)
involving all sorts of mudslinging in the case (warning: lots of curses).
  * [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a neat project to create
    free maps, similar to Google Maps, Bing Maps, etc.  Cool stuff, and all the
map data is Creative Commons, meaning it could be used for any number of shiny
projects.
  * There[ might be
    life](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19005-hints-of-life-found-on-saturn-moon.html)
on Saturn's moon, Titan, observations courtesy of the NASA/ESA/ASI Cassini
mission, which has been bouncing around the Saturnian system since mid-2004
after launch way back in 1997.  It's far from a sure thing, but it's really
exciting that predictions of how life might work on Titan have been supported by
observation.
  * [This
    study](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/techreports/cse/2010/CSE-TR-564-10.pdf)
(PDF) of internet routing to previously unused blocks is quite interesting,
especially the numerous
[SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) streams pointed
at 1.1.1.1 (section 5.1).
  * The EFF (kind of like the ACLU of internet, if you're not familiar with
    them) recently put out the [HTTPS
Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) extension for Firefox.  When
it's this easy to lock down your web traffic, there's no reason not to.  What's
your excuse?
  * Huge things are cool.  Want to feel tiny?  Go ask Wikipedia about the [local
    supercluster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_Supercluster), then
consider how tiny everything humanity knows is,   relative to that.  When you're
done scrabbling about in your own Total   Perspective Vortex, consider [epic
timescales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1E19_s) for extra kicks.  Yeah..
cosmology is awesome.  <figure> <a

<img src="/images/2010/Universe_Reference_Map_%28Location%29_001.jpg" /> </a>
</figure>
  * Exasecond timescales are impressive, but then there's the depressing concept
    of the [universe's heat
death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe).  [What
if](http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html) there were a way to [reverse
entropy](http://www.multivax.com/)?
  * How did I not know [this
    album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Empires) exists?  There are some
really good mixes on it..

..and that's several weeks of accumulated cool-things.  Enjoy.
