What critics (the contest judgest) are saying about WEB1999:

An excellent instance of a screensaver modeled after both the golden age of screensavers and the golden
age of the internet. Callbacks to both classic internet culture and the calculator community of yore,
with a few easter eggs to boot. No key input required, other than to exit the screensaver. Extremely thorough
readme, including a history/background on each of the "windows" that can appear.

It looks great. The posterization and dithering really gives the feel of the 90s,
and the use of an even more limited palette is a clever way to work within the
bounds. Capturing the nostalgia of having just way too many popups.

An HTML readme that looks like it's from '99? Nice!
