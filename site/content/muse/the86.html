A short overview of some lesser-known or generally useful features of the
TI-86, from the standpoint of writing programs in assembly.

<h2>Ports</h2>
<h3>0 - LCD memory map</h3>

Port 0 controls the memory address the display hardware will read from when
refreshing the screen.  (Unlike the 83+ and similar, the 85 and 86 have
memory-mapped displays, which make drawing much faster in software.)
To get the address read, take the value in port 0, add 0xC0, and multiply by
0x100.  For example, the typical value of 0x3C puts the display buffer at 0xFC00.
Put another way, the value of the port is the high byte of the buffer address minus
0xC0.  For that reason, the display buffer must always be in the uppermost 16k
of memory.

The block of memory at 0xCA00 is often used as a secondary display buffer (either
for greyscale via buffer-flipping or just double-buffered drawing).  The system's
graph buffer is based at 0xCA06 and evidently whatever's immediately below that isn't
critical, but the 6 bytes at 0xCDFA <em>are</em> potentially important, so you
should back those up if using the buffer at 0xCA00.

Bit 1 of port 3 reads reset if the LCD is currently refreshing, which can be
useful for preventing tearing when flipping between buffers (vsync!).

<h3>1 - Keypad</h3>

This one behaves just like the other z80 calculators.  Write a mask out and
read back a value with bits reset corresponding to the keys currently depressed
within the corresponding group.  The following table gives the mask for each
group and the keys corresponding to each bit on a per-group basis (all values
in hex, unused values are blank):

<table style="margin:0 0 .75em 1.5em;border:1px solid black">

</table>

<h3>3 - ON key, power, interrupt mask</h3>

Bit 3 controls whether the LCD is on.  Write it set to turn the display off,
and reset to turn it on.  Read bit 3 to get the current state of the ON key
(which is conspicuously absent from the above table, since it's more closely
tied to system interrupts than the rest of the keypad).  Reads reset when
the key is down, otherwise set.

My notes mention you should reset the system flag in bit 4 of (IY+9) when
you want to check the ON key's status, but not
why you would want to do that.  Presumably the default ISR does something with
the ON key when that bit is set.

The lower bits (I assume 0-2, but not sure) of this port control what interrupt
sources will actually fire an interrupt in the CPU.  My notes are incomplete here,
but I know bit 0 is for the ON key.  I assume the other two are timer interrupts
and link activity, but that's mostly just speculation.

<h3>4 - Power management</h3>

Write bit 0 set for normal power mode, or reset for low-power mode.  Not sure
what all this does, but if you want to work like a &quot;real&quot; power-down
write this bit reset before halting the CPU (..and waiting for an interrupt).
This port reads back the last value written to it.

<h3>5, 6 - Memory paging</h3>

Port 5 controls memory paging in bank 1 (0x4000-0x7FFF), and port 6 does the same
on bank 2 (0x8000-0xBFFF).  I'm not sure exactly what ranges are valid, but
one should only need to change these in rare occasions.  Both read the last
value written, which is useful if you want to flip pages and restore them to
the old value when you're done.

<h3>7 - Link port</h3>

Like the other Z80 calculators made by TI, the link port is two lines with
pull-up resistors on both lines.  Writing bit 0 or 1 set pulls the corresponding
line low, which can be read on the other end of the link.

<h2>Interrupts</h2>

<h3>Hooks</h3>

The default IM 1 ISR includes a hook you can insert to have your own code called
each time an interrupt fires.  Place up to 200 bytes of code at 0xD2FE and
calculate a checksum, then set bit 2 of the flag at (IY+0x23) as follows:

<div class="fbox"><pre>    ld de,$28                       ; Initial value
    ld a,(_alt_interrupt_exec)
    ld hl,_alt_int_chksum + $28
    add a,(hl)
    add hl,de
    add a,(hl)
    add hl,de
    add a,(hl)
    add hl,de
    add a,(hl)
    add hl,de
    add a,(hl)
    ld (_alt_int_chksum),a
    set 2,(iy + $23)                ; Enable user routine
    ei                              ; Ensure interrupts are enabled</pre>
</div>

<h3>Power-off</h3>

Between port 4 (above) and a few flags, making the machine look like it's properly
off (on these calculators, waiting for an interrupt is as close to off they get
without removing the batteries) is pretty easy:

<div class="fbox"><pre>    di
    ld      a,1
    out     ($03),a                      ; Wait for ON key int
    res     shift2nd,(iy+shiftflags)     ; Clear 2nd status
    res     onRunning,(iy+onflags)       ; Calc no longer running
    ei
    halt                                 ; Wait for on key interrupt</pre>
</div>

<h3>'Down-Left Bug'</h3>

Apparently something in the default ISR can crash the calculator if you hold
the down and left arrow keys.  Setting bit 2 at (IY+0x12) is one way to avoid
it (which I assume also has some other effect, but my notes don't specify), or
you can install your own interrupt handler in IM 2 which bypasses the flawed
logic:

<div class="fbox"><pre>    ex af,af'
    exx
    in a,(3)
    rra
    push af         ; 
    call nc,$01A1   ; Call out to system ISR - not needed if you only
    pop af          ; read the keyboard via port 1 rather than the ROM calls
    ld a,9
    adc a,0
    out (3),a
    ld a,$0B
    out (3),a
    ex af,af'
    exx
    ei
    reti</pre></div>
<h3 id="Speedy%20processing">Speedy processing</h3>

The above interrupt to be installed in IM 2 is evidently somewhat faster
than the system ISR.  If you don't want to or are unable to install the vector
table necessary for IM 2 setup, similar speed can be achieved by installing
an interrupt hook as described earlier in this document, then popping the top
value from the stack into oblivion and returning at your leisure:

<div class="fbox"><pre>    ; your interrupt code here
    inc sp
    inc sp
    reti    ; ISR done</pre>
</div>

<h2>Error handlers</h2>

Some ROM calls will throw system errors, not nicely returning error status.
You can register an error handler routine by calling _InstError with HL pointing
to your handler code.  If/when your handler is invoked (by an error), the error
code will be in A.  Do not return from the handler (the invoker plays with the
stack before calling your routine), instead do whatever you like and tell the
system to put your program away by calling _jforcecmdnochar when done with
reporting the error or cleaning up or whatnot.
