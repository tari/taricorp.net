<h2>Generally</h2>
This is taricorp.net, dumping grounds of the ideas, thoughts, and random musings
of myself, Peter Marheine.  The navigation links to the right list the site's
main categories:

- **Home** - the main page, with listings of all the latest activity.
- **About** - this page!
- **Blog** - the blog, where little things and general pointlessness which
             don't belong in any other category go.
- **Projects** - repository of various projects of mine, particularly hardware
                 and software development.
- **Muse** - the place for more meaningful articles and thoughts- as in the blog,
             but more complete.
- **Contact** - a way to contact me, should you have no other way to do so.

<h2>This site</h2>
The site is served from Amazon's [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as a set of
pure static pages.

Content pages are generated by [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde),
a Python static site generator with a few site processors and template tags
of my own creation.  All templates and pages are hand-written, mostly in
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [vim](http://www.vim.org/),
so you're likely to find some little bonuses in the page source, should the
desire strike.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
I strive to ensure that everything on the site is handled gracefully even in
less-capable user agents such as [elinks](http://www.elinks.cz/) or
[w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net), most significantly by avoiding the use of
client-side scripting (i.e., JavaScript) wherever possible, but also by
including images only sparingly.

<!--The site is also available over ipv6 at
[ipv6.taricorp.net](http://ipv6.taricorp.net) for everyone out there who
wants to be future-proof.-->
<!-- Or not, because Amazon don't have any IPv6 on AWS.. -->

<h2>Me</h2>
Mentioned above, I'm Peter Marheine.  As of the fall of 2009, I am studying
for a BS in Computer Engineering at
[Michigan Technological University](http://www.mtu.edu/), with a primary focus
of embedded systems design and programming.  Outside of my studies, I do
a variety of technology-related things, mostly involving some sort of
programming.  The notable (and somewhat complete) ones can be found in the
[projects](/projects/) sections of this site.

My OpenPGP public key is available on this site, at
[/pmarheine.asc](/pmarheine.asc).

<h3>Around the web</h3>
There are a number of other places I can be found around the web, usually going
by the alias of 'tari' or some variant thereof.  Some of the more notable
places I can be found:

-   Some of my personal programs have repositories over on
    [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org/tari/).
-   I lurk on some technology forums with a slant towards programming
    Texas Instruments graphing calculators (the platform which I got my start
    programming on).  See
    [Cemetech](http://www.cemetech.net/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=433)
    for the main one.
-   I maintain a personal presence on a number of other sites too, but the
    more interesting ones include
    [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/taricorp/) and
    [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/taricorp).

<h3>Other people</h3>
I know these people and have some interest in what they have to say:

-   [Nick 'in beta'](http://in-beta.com) does the occasional bit of
    interesting and a lot of web design.
-   [Jon 'Jonimus'](http://jonimoose.net) mucks about with open source
    software a good amount.

<h3>Points of interest</h3>
Some of the places I pay attention to but don't necessarily interact with in
any tangible way:

-   ** [Ars Technica](http://www.arstechnica.com) ** - mostly tech-related
    news and the occasional opinion piece.
-   ** [Boing Boing](http://www.boingboing.net) ** - wonderful things and the
    occasional bit of news.
-   ** [Hack a Day](http://www.hackaday.com) ** - creating and tweaking
    (mostly) electronics.
