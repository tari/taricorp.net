<h2>Generally</h2>
This is taricorp.net, dumping grounds of the ideas, thoughts, and random musings
of myself, Peter Marheine.  The navigation links to the right list the site's
main categories:

- **Home** - the main page, with listings of all the latest activity.
- **About** - this page!
- **Blog** - the blog, where little things and general pointlessness which
             don't belong in any other category go.
- **Projects** - repository of various projects of mine, particularly hardware
                 and software development.
- **Muse** - the place for more meaningful articles and thoughts- as in the blog,
             but more complete.
- **Contact** - a way to contact me, should you have no other way to do so.

<h2>Me</h2>

<h2>This site</h2>
The site is served from a machine instance running
[Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) in Amazon's
[EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) cloud service, with
with [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/) handling the actual serving
duties.

Content pages are generated by [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde),
a Python static site generator with a few site processors and template tags
of my own creation.  All templates and pages are hand-written, mostly in
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [vim](http://www.vim.org/),
so you're likely to find some little bonuses in the page source, should the
desire strike.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>
I strive to ensure that everything on the site is handled gracefully even in
less-capable user agents such as [elinks](http://www.elinks.cz/) or
[w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net), most significantly by avoiding the use of
client-side scripting (i.e., JavaScript) wherever possible, but also by
including images only sparingly.

The site is also available over ipv6 at
[ipv6.taricorp.net](http://ipv6.taricorp.net) for everyone out there who
wants to be future-proof.
