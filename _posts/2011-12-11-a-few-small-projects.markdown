Going through some of my old projects this evening, I came across a couple
little tools I wrote.  I've uploaded them here in the hope that others will find
them useful.  They are the [GCNClient GUI](/projects/gcnclient-gui) and [RX BRR
calculator](/projects/rx-brr-calc).

I make no guarantees of the utility of these pieces of software, but they may be
useful as examples in how to perform some task in the .NET framework (both are
written in C# for .NET), or just for performing the very specific tasks which
they are designed to perform.
