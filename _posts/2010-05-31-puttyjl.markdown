After putting up with the lack of support for Windows 7's [jump
lists](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/jump-lists)
in PuTTY for a while, I finally got tired enough of it to do something.Â  Nothing
as cool as patching PuTTY to do them itself, but I wrote a wrapper which indexes
the saved sessions, allowing the user to select which ones should be included in
the list.

From the [project page](/projects/puttyjl.html):

> PuTTYJL is a wrapper and patch for
> [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/) written in C#
> for .NET 3.5 and Windows 7,  adding support for the new [Jump
> Lists](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/jump-lists),
> allowing you to create jump list  entries for saved sessions in the registry
> and optionally just launch  the wrapper to start a default session in
> PuTTY.

Get it [here](/projects/puttyjl.html).

**Update 2014-12-01**: PuTTY gained official support for jump lists in
version 0.61, released back in 2011. You probably want to use that instead.
