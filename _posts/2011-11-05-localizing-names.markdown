When I'm not thinking in or of computer languages, one of the things that I find
consistently interesting is natural languages. As such, I'll occasionally spend
some time simply puzzling over bits of language (for which purpose [Language
Log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/) is an excellent feed of topics).

As it happened, I spent some time today informing myself more on the fairly
well-known [conlangs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conlang) Esperanto and
Lojban. I find each of them interesting, although my usual pragmatic approach to
things probably means I'll never do any serious study or either.

The point of this rambling, however, is that an
[exercise](http://www.tlg.uci.edu/%7Eopoudjis/lojbanbrochure/lessons/less1alphabet.html)
in _Lojban For Beginners_ challenges the reader to spell their name using the
lojban orthography. Jumping off from there, I endeavoured to see how my name
might be translated to other languages.

Beginning with Lojban, I believe my name might be written as **pitir.mar'aini**
(using the Latin orthography). For the uninitiated, the '.' is a full stop,
since Lojban doesn't routinely capitalize (it mainly serves to denote unusual
emphasis in pronounciation) nor is spacing a strictly enforced part of notation.
Beyond that, the apostrophe is actually pronounced as an 'h' would be in
English, and is considered a letter rather than a piece of punctuation.
Everything else is fairly straightforward, just using rather different spelling
conventions than might be seen in English.

Overall, I find that the Lojban orthography is pretty easy to get a hold of as a
native English speaker. But what about some other languages? I have a bit of
experience with Japanese, so I gave that one a try.

Coming up with a proper equivalent of my name with Japanese orthography is a bit
of a kludge, since Japanese names are traditionally written with kanji, and so
may also be considered to encode literal meanings[citation needed]. Choosing
appropriate kanji for a translation of my name is far outside my expertise and
it would sound completely different (and thus diverges from the point of this
exercise), so I'll settle with a katakana approximation:
**ピーター・マルハイニ**. I use katakana here because it is traditionally used
for words of foreign origin, which indeed my name is.

It's an interesting challenge to transliterate from a European language (English
here) into Japanese, since the Japanese syllabary is [almost exclusively
open](http://iprc.soest.hawaii.edu/users/furue/jp-pron.html) (that is, the
sounds end with vowels). In this case, I had to fudge my given name (Peter),
since Japanese completely lacks the sound that 'r' provides in English- it
becomes 'PeTa' instead, which I find to be acceptably close (the ーs denote long
vowels).

In 'Marheine', the 'rh' construct is difficult, since it's a consonant cluster
which doesn't fit into the aforementioned open syllables. For that, I fudged it
with 'ru', which is (as far as I can deduce) a fairly common trick.

While I'm considering Japanese pronounciation, it's worth mentioning the
characters in the header on this web site (タリ). That's a representation of my
usual alias, Tari, in katakana.
