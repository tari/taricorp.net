I caught on to a promotion from AVNet last week, in which one may get a
[free](http://www.em.avnet.com//en-us/design/featuredpromotions/Pages/Maxim-MAX5214LITE-Evaluation-Kit-and-Signal-Generator-Offer.aspx?intcmp=aehomepage_whatsnew_maximjuly)
[MAX5214 eval
board](http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/data-converters/digital-to-analog-converters/MAX5214DACLITE.html)
(available through August 31), so hopped on it because really, why wouldn't I
turn down free hardware? I promptly forgot about it until today, when a box
arrived from AVNet.

## What's on the board

The board features four Maxim ICs:

  * **MAX8510**- small low-power LDO.  Not terribly interesting.
  * **MAXQ622**- 16-bit microcontroller with USB.  I didn't even know Maxim make microcontrollers!
  * **MAX5214**- 14-bit SPI DAC. The most interesting part.
  * **MAX6133**- precision 3V LDO (provides supply for the DAC)

The MAXQ622 micro (U2) is connected to a USB mini-B port for data, and USB also
supplies power for the 5V rail.  The MAX8510 (U4) supplies power for the
microcontroller and also the MAX6133 (U3).  The microcontroller acts as a USB
bridge to the MAX5214 DAC (U1), which it communicates with over SPI.  The SPI
signals are also broken out to a 4-pin header (J6).

## Software

The software included with the board is fairly straightforward, providing a
small variety of waveforms that can be generated. It's best demonstrated
photographically, as below. Those familiar with National Instruments' LabView
environment will probably recognize that this interface is actually just a
LabView VI (Virtual Instrument).

## Hacking

Rather more interesting than the stock software is the possibility of
reprogramming the microcontroller. Looking at the board photos, we can see that
there's a header that breaks out the JTAG signals. With the right
[tools](http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/microcontrollers/development_tools.cfm/view/low-power),
it shouldn't be very difficult to write a custom firmware to open up a
communication protocol to the device (perhaps change its device class to a [USB
CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_communications_device_class) for easier
interfacing). Reprogramming the device requires some sort of JTAG adapter, but I
can probably make a [Bus Pirate](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate) do the job.

With some custom software, this could become a handy little function generator-
its precision is good and it has a handy USB connection. On the downside, the
slew rate on the DAC is not anything special (0.5V/µs, -3dB bandwidth is 100
kHz), and its output current rating is pretty pathetic (5 mA typical). With a
unity-gain amplifier on the output though, it could easily drive decent loads
and act as a handy low-cost waveform generator. Let's get hacking?
