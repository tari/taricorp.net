Localization of software, while not [trivial][perl-maketext], is not a
particularly novel problem. Where it gets more interesting is in
resource-constrained systems, where your ability to display strings
is limited by display resolution and memory limitations may make it
difficult to include multiple localized copies of any given string in
a single binary. All of this is then on top of the usual (admittedly slight
in well-designed systems) difficulty in selecting a language at runtime
and maintaining reasonably readable code.

This all comes to mind following discussion of providing
[translations of Doors CSE][translation-thread], a piece of software for
the TI-84+ Color Silver Edition[^1] that falls squarely into the "embedded
software" category. The simple approach (and the one taken in previous versions
of Doors CS) to localizing it is just replacing the hard-coded strings
and rebuilding.

[^1]: That name sounds stupider every time I write it out. Henceforth, it's
      just "the CSE."

As something of a joke, it was proposed to make additional "joke" translations,
for languages such as Klingon or [pirate][pirate-translation]. I proposed a
[Hodor][hodor] translation, along the lines of the [Hodor UI patch][xposed][^java]
for Android. After making that suggestion, I decided to exercise my skills a
bit and actually make one.

[hodor]: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hodor
[xposed]: http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.germainz.hodor
[^java]: The programmer of that one took is surprisingly far, such that all
         of the code that feasibly can be is also
         [Hodor-filled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GermainZ/Hodor/b6e90c00a616ddd7bc66eb7c42c896d88f70733c/src/com/germainz/hodor/Hodor.java).

## Hodor (Implementation)[^hodor]

Since I don't have access to the source code of Doors CSE, I had to modify
the binary to rewrite the strings. Referring the to [file format guide][linkguide],
we are aware that TI-8x applications are mostly Intel hex, with a short header.
Additionally, I know that these applications are cryptographically signed which
implies I will need to resign the application when I have made my changes.

### Dumping contents

I installed the [IntelHex][intelhex] module in a Python virtualenv to process
the file into a format easier to modify, though I ended up not needing much
capability from there. I simply used a hex editor to remove the header from
the 8ck file (the first 0x4D bytes).

Simply trying to convert the 8ck payload to binary without further processing
doesn't work in this case, because Doors CSE is a multipage application. On these
calculators Flash applications are split into 16-kilobyte pages which get swapped
into the memory bank at 0x4000. Thus the logical address of the beginning of each
page is 0x4000, and programs that are not aware of the special delimiters used in
the TI format (to delimit pages) handle this poorly. The raw hex file (after removing
the 8ck header) looks like this:

```

Lines 1 and 7 here are the TI-specific page markers, indicating the beginning
of pages 0 and 1, respectively. The lines following each of those contain
32 (`20` hex) bytes of data starting at address 0x40000 (`4000`). I extracted
the data from each page out to its own file with a text editor, minus the
page delimiter. From there, I was able to use the `hex2bin.py` script provided
with the `IntelHex` module to create two binary files, one for each page.

### Modifying strings

With two binary files, I was ready to modify some strings. The calculator's
character set mostly coincides with ASCII, so I used the `strings` program
packaged with GNU binutils to examine the strings in the image.

```
$ strings page00.bin
HDoorsCSE
##6M#60>
oJ:T
        Uo&
dQ:T
[snip]
xImprove BASIC editor
Display clock
Enable lowercase
Always launch Doors CSE
Launch Doors CSE with
PRGM]
```

With some knowledge of the strings in there, it was reasonably short work to
find them with a hex editor (in this case I used [HxD][hxd]) and replace
them with variants on the string "Hodor".

[hxd]: http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/

    <img src="/images/2014/hodor-page00.png" />
    <figcaption>HxD helpfully highlights modified bytes in red.</figcaption>
</figure>

I also found that page 1 of the application contains no meaningful strings,
so I ended up only needing to examine page 0. Some of the reported strings
require care in modification, because they refer to system-invariant strings.
For example, "OFFSCRPT" appears in there, which I know from experience is
the magic name which may be given to an AppVar to make the calculator
execute its contents when turned off. Thus I did not modify that string,
in addition to a few others (names of authors, URLs, etc).

### Repacking

I ran `bin2hex.py` to convert the modified page 0 binary back into hex, and
pasted the contents of that file back into the whole-app hex file (replacing
the original contents of page 0). From there, I had to re-sign the
binary.[^signing] [WikiTI points out][wikiti] how easy that process is, so I
[installed rabbitsign][aur] and went on my merry way:

```
$ rabbitsign -g -r -o HodorCSE.8ck HodorCSE.hex
```

[^signing]: This signature doesn't identify the author, as you might assume.
            Once upon a time TI provided the ability for application authors
            to pay some amount of money to get a signing key associated with
            them personally, but that system never saw wide use. Nowadays
            everybody signs their applications with the public "freeware" keys,
            just because the calculator requires that all apps be signed and
            the public keys must be stored on the calculator (of which the freeware
            keys are preinstalled on all of them).

### Testing

I loaded the app up in an emulator to give it a quick test, and was met by
complete nonsense, as intended.

I'm providing the final [modified 8ck][8ck] here, for the amusement
of my readers. I don't suggest that anybody use it seriously, not for the least
reason that I didn't test it at all thoroughly to be sure I didn't inadvertently
break something.

## Extending the concept

It's relatively easy to extend this concept to the calculator's OS as well
(and in fact similar string replacements have been done before) with the
[OS signing keys][os-keys] in hand. I lack the inclination to do so,
but surely somebody else would be able to do something fun with it using the
process I outlined here.
