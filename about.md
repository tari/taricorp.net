## Generally


This is taricorp.net, dumping grounds of the ideas, thoughts, and random musings of myself, Peter Marheine. The navigation links to the right list the site's main categories:



	
  * **Home** - the main page, with listings of all the latest activity.

	
  * **About** - this page!

	
  * **Projects** - repository of various projects of mine, particularly hardware and software development.

	
  * **Muse** - the place for more meaningful articles and thoughts- as in the blog, but more complete.

	
  * **Contact** - a way to contact me, should you have no other way to do so.




## This site


I strive to ensure that everything on the site is handled gracefully even in less-capable user agents such as [elinks](http://www.elinks.cz/) or [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/), most significantly by avoiding the use of client-side scripting (i.e., JavaScript) wherever possible, but also by including images only sparingly.


## Me


Mentioned above, I'm Peter Marheine. As of the fall of 2009, I am studying for a BS in Computer Engineering at [Michigan Technological University](http://www.mtu.edu/), with a primary focus of embedded systems design and programming. Outside of my studies, I do a variety of technology-related things, mostly involving some sort of programming. The notable (and somewhat complete) ones can be found in the [projects](http://www.taricorp.net/projects) sections of this site.

At MTU, I am the current server administrator for the [Linux/UNIX User's Group](http://lug.mtu.edu/), and am a member of the [Blue Marble Security](http://www.bluemarblesecurity.com/) enterprise's software development team.

My PGP public key is available on this site, at [/pmarheine.asc](http://www.taricorp.net/pmarheine.asc) (ID DF2157CD, fingerprint 7F62 ECC0 B2FE 8E57 4DAC E707 7DDD 3675 DF21 57CD, externally verifiable with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/PMarheine/status/162561806861213696)).  A copy of my resumé, among other things, is available at [me.taricorp.net](http://me.taricorp.net/).


### Around the web


There are a number of other places I can be found around the web, usually going by the alias of 'tari' or some variant thereof. Some of the more notable places I can be found:



	
  * Some of my personal programs have repositories over on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tari/).

	
  * I lurk on some technology forums with a slant towards programming Texas Instruments graphing calculators (the platform which I got my start programming on). See [Cemetech](http://www.cemetech.net/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=433) for the main one.

	
  * I maintain a personal presence on a number of other sites too, but the more interesting ones include [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/taricorp/) and [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/taricorp).  Many more can be found in the sidebar.




### Other people


I know these people and have some interest in what they have to say:



	
  * [Nick 'in beta'](http://in-beta.com/) does the occasional bit of interesting and a lot of web design.

	
  * [Jon 'Jonimus'](http://jonimoose.net/) mucks about with open source software a good amount.




### Points of interest


Some of the places I pay attention to but don't necessarily interact with in any tangible way:



	
  * ** [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/) ** - mostly tech-related news and the occasional opinion piece.

	
  * ** [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/) ** - wonderful things and the occasional bit of news.

	
  * ** [Hack a Day](http://hackaday.com/) ** - creating and tweaking (mostly) electronics.




## Tracking


I like having data on what people are looking for on the site and what's useful, so I use self-hosted [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) for analytics, which doesn't share your visit information with parties that use it for potentially nefarious purposes.
